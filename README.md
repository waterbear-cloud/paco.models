Install this package with your Python tool of choice. Typically set-up a virtualenv
and pip install the dependencies in there:

    python -m venv env

    ./env/bin/pip install -e .

There are unit tests using PyTest. If you are using VS Code you can turn on the
"Py Test Enabled" setting and run "Discover Unit Tests" command.
